Word documents are widely used for creating and sharing content due to their robust formatting options and ease of use. However, when it comes to publishing content online or collaborating with developers, converting these documents to Markdown format is often necessary. 

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that’s easy to read and write, making it ideal for online platforms like GitHub, blogs, and documentation sites.
