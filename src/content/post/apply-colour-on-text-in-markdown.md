## Outline: How to Apply Colour to Text in Markdown  

### Introduction  
- Overview of Markdown as a lightweight markup language.  
- Mention its limitations in native styling, particularly for text color.  
- Highlight tools and techniques to overcome these limitations.

### Markdown's Native Limitations  
- Markdown is designed for simplicity and focuses on structure over styling.  
- No built-in support for text colors in standard Markdown syntax.  

### General Methods for Adding Color in Markdown  
- **Using HTML Inline Styles**  
  - Markdown supports embedding HTML for extended formatting.  
  - Example:  
    ```markdown
    <span style="color: blue;">This text is blue.</span>
    ```
- **Leveraging CSS for Styling**  
  - External or inline CSS can define custom color styles.  
  - Example with CSS classes:  
    ```html
    <style>
      .custom-blue { color: blue; }
    </style>
    <span class="custom-blue">This text is styled with CSS.</span>
    ```
- **Markdown Extensions**  
  - Some Markdown flavors and tools provide additional support for advanced features.  

### Adding Colors in Jupyter Notebook Markdown  
- Jupyter Notebook allows HTML in Markdown cells for styling.  
  - Example using inline HTML:  
    ```markdown
    <span style="color: green;">This text is green.</span>
    ```  
- Using CSS for global styling:  
  - Modify Jupyter themes or add custom CSS in `custom.css` to apply consistent styles.  
- Use cases in Jupyter: Highlighting code, marking outputs, or adding emphasis in notes.  

### Adding Colors in Obsidian Markdown  
- Inline HTML for basic styling:  
  ```markdown
  <span style="color: red;">This text is red.</span>
  ```  
- Custom CSS snippets:  
  - Example snippet:  
    ```css
    .custom-purple {
        color: purple;
    }
    ```  
  - Steps to add CSS snippets in Obsidian:  
    - Create a `.css` file in the Obsidian snippets folder.  
    - Enable the snippet from the Obsidian settings.  
  - Applying the class in notes:  
    ```markdown
    <span class="custom-purple">This is styled with a custom snippet.</span>
    ```  
- Plugins for styling, such as *Style Settings*, for a no-code approach to custom colors.  

### Using GitHub-Flavored Markdown (GFM) for Colors  
- GitHub-Flavored Markdown does not directly support text colors but provides alternative formatting options:  
  - **Code Blocks for Highlighting**:  
    ```markdown
    ```diff
    - This is a red-like text (removed).
    + This is green-like text (added).
    ```
    ```
  - Colored emojis or badges to represent key highlights visually.  
  - Limitations of GFM: HTML is often stripped out in Markdown previews on GitHub.  

### Practical Use Cases for Colored Text  
- Emphasizing warnings, tips, or alerts in documentation.  
- Differentiating elements in notes or presentations.  
- Making interactive notebooks or blogs more visually engaging.

### Accessibility and Compatibility Considerations  
- Avoid over-reliance on colors; provide alternative cues like bold text or symbols.  
- Choose high-contrast colors for better readability and accessibility.  
- Ensure compatibility across Markdown viewers, some of which may not render colors.  

### Conclusion  
- Recap the various ways to add color to Markdown.  
- Recommend selecting methods that suit the target platform, such as Jupyter or Obsidian.  
- Emphasize accessibility and reader-friendly design when applying colors.
